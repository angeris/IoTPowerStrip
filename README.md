# Stanford IoT Power Strip

## Overview

This is a Smart Power Strip project for the Stanford IoT group, which aims to create a simple, relatively cheap interface for a power strip that can be home-built and is open source.

This repository provides a sample server in Python, an API, and the Arduino
code for the project.
