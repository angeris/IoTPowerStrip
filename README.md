# Stanford IoT Power Strip

## Overview

This is a Smart Power Strip project for the Stanford IoT group, which aims to create a simple, relatively cheap interface for a power strip that can be home-built and is open source.

This repository provides a sample server in Python, an API, and the Arduino
code for the project.

For more information about the Stanford IoT group, please visit the IoT website.

## Arduino

This folder provides all of the Arduino code for the project. In general, this code should not be modified unless its being tailored to specific applications, or unless a patch is being submitted. Note that this is not being written using the Arduino IDE, but rather using the [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) manager/builder which is IDE-independent.

## PowerStripArduinoAPI

Provides the API and a sample server.

## Contributors
This project is currently being developed by Guillermo Andres Angeris, Dan Yu, and Christopher Mehdi Elamri.
